# iOS App Backend in .NET 8.0

This repository contains the backend for an iOS application, developed using .NET 8.0. This backend provides a RESTful API to support various features of the app, such as user authentication, data storage, and API endpoints for core functionality.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Supports JWT-based user authentication.
- **RESTful API**: Provides a RESTful API for iOS app communication.
- **Data Storage**: Utilizes Entity Framework Core for data handling and storage.
- **Environment Configuration**: Configurable for development, staging, and production environments.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Integrates logging and error handling for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or any compatible database
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
https://github.com/Markusloka/yellowTrunk.git
cd repo-name
```

### 2. Set up the Database

1. **Database Configuration**: Update the database connection string in `appsettings.json` or configure environment variables.

   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Your_Database_Connection_String"
   }
   ```

2. **Database Migrations**: Run migrations to set up the database schema.

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

### 3. Run the Application

To start the backend server, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The server should be running at `http://localhost:5000` (or the configured port).

## API Documentation

All API endpoints are documented and accessible through Swagger. Visit `http://localhost:5000/swagger` after starting the server to view the API documentation.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- **ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT**: Defines the environment (Development, Staging, Production).
- **ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection**: The database connection string.

### Logging

This backend uses the built-in .NET logging library for logging information, warnings, and errors.

## Deployment

For deployment, ensure the following:

1. Set up a production database and update the connection string.
2. Configure the hosting server to use the `.NET 8.0 runtime`.
3. Configure the application to use the `Production` environment.
